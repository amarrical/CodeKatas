We're doing Fizz Buzz!

Requirements:
TDD
Console application.
Must accept a minimum and maximum number to display.
Must accept a "mutator" (divisor to replace and replacement)
Must allow compound replacements in order of divisor.

The actual application that runs does not need to allow user input, 
	but the main program must accept these changes.
